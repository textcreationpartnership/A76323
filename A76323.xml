         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Munday</hi> the 9<hi>th.</hi> of this Inſtant, he came very ill from <hi>London,</hi> having the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, and an extream Looſeneſs moſt part of that Day; the next Day after he came home, he was ſeized with a moſt violent Vomiting, and Looſeneſs; Phyſitians were ſent for, who attended him three days, but his Diſtemper en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, on <hi>Thurſday</hi> Two other Phyſitians were joyn'd in Conſultation about him: his Diſeaſe ſtill grew upon him, and he being very Apprehenſive that it would iſſue in his Death, and underſtanding that the Lord Chief Iuſtice

               <hi>North</hi> would be there to hold the Aſſized the 16<hi>th.</hi> Inſtant, expreſſed a very great deſire to ſpeak with his Lordſhip, for diſcharging of his conſcience, in depoſing ſomewhat which he had not before diſcloſed; with which his Lordſhip being made acquainted, was pleaſed that night at his requeſt to go to him; before whom he did by many repeated aſſe verations, upon the words of a dying man, declare, <hi>That in all the great buſineſs of the Plot, he ſpoke nothing againſt any Perſon upon Oath, or otherwiſe by way of Accuſation, but what was true;</hi> and only complain'd that he had been too Timerous, and rather leſſen'd his evidence in ſome particulars.</p>
            <p>After ſome ſhort time, the Company were deſired to withdraw: and none being left with him but the Lord Chief Iuſtice, Capt. <hi>Bedlows</hi> Wife, and the Iudges Clerk, My Lord gave ſhe ſaid Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> his Oath, and his Clerk took a pretty long Depoſition in Writing, the Contents whereof are yet Secret: only thus far we know he made Oath, That whatſoever he had declared to the King and Council, and Secret Committee, and at the ſeveral Tryals upon Oath, were all true, upon the words of <gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 word">

ſhortly to appear before the great <hi>Iehovah,</hi> the maker of all fleſh, where he ſhould ſtand with a clear conſcience as to all matters of the Plot, wherein he had given Evidence. He ſaid more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to the Iudge: My Lord, ſome will not believe the Plot, or pretend it at leaſt. My Lord, I ſpeak the more, becauſe I know not but that I may dye this night. He very often ſaid to my Lord Chief Iuſtice with great ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, My Lord! I pitty the King! I pitty the King! His Life is in danger! they will Poyſon, or cut him off! they are going towards it! they are carrying on the Plot! the <hi>Papiſt<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

When my Lord was going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, he call'd him back again, took him by the hand, and beg'd him to preſent his moſt Humble Duty to the King, and to tell him he was his moſt Loyal and Dutiful Subject, and to beſeech Him to take care of himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 17<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> towards the Evening, he appear'd worſe than he had been all his Sickneſs before; ſome about him ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſeveral queſtions about his Depoſition he replyed, He was a very weak man, and would talk no more of Temporal things.</p>
